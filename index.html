    <h1>Cars MPG Observation by Fuel and Cylinder</h1>
    <h3>This is an interactive narrative visualization using D3.js to analyze automobile data from 2017. 
        It features different scenes, including a scatter plot and a bar chart, 
        to compare metrics like city and highway MPG, 
        visually representing these comparisons and trends through user-driven interactions. 
        The visualization is enhanced with dynamic elements such as tooltips and sorting functionalities, 
        allowing users to explore in-depth data based on vehicle attributes like engine cylinders and fuel type.</h3>

    <div id="scatter-description" style="width: 960px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 10px; text-align: justify; display: none;">
            <p>The scatterplot chart illustrates the relationship between Average Highway MPG (X-axis) and Average City MPG (Y-axis), 
                using circles to represent data points where the size indicates the number of Engine Cylinders. 
                It shows a positive correlation, indicating that vehicles with higher city MPG often also achieve higher highway MPG. 
                The data points cluster in patterns that reflect distinct groups by cylinder count.</p>
